# Sort tabs advanced

https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/developers/addon/sort-tabs-advanced/

Web extension for sorting tabs by various criteria:

* url
* domain
* title
* last time of access

I found myself frustrated that it's not possible to sort tabs by domain in Firefox 57.

Then, I discovered that sorting tabs by access time is kinda useful.
You can push the tabs you use often to the top, sinking old ones saved for later.

## Building the extension

Run `build.sh`, which uses `web-ext`.

## TODO

* Improve UI
* Improve icon
* Performance
